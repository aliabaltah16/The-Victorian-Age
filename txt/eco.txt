The economy of the 19th century did experience a rapid growth across Europe with the help of the Industrial revolution and new resources from the colonies.

The Industrial revolution spread from UK to the rest of Europe during the Victorian age. The new farming parakites and new crops from the colonies meant that people that just to farm now went unapplied. The unapplied farmers started to move to cities where they got jobs in factories. When those cities grew; the need to transport products and resources between them grew. Enter the trains and the railway that made it easy and faster to transport large contents of resources between cities. This was especially good for the factories because now raw resources could be transported to them and finishes products could be exported away from the factories easier and faster. Many invasions and discoveries were created and put to use in the new factories.

The colonies did not only bring new plants to Europe. It did also bring rare resources that were refined and developed to become command goods. That could be sold or be put to use in the new factories. To have a colony was extremely profitable not only because of the resources you could extract but also because of the natives in the colonies that could be sold off as slaves in the United States of America. Until the American civil war when they banned slavery.

During the late 19th century the scramble for colonies across the world became more and more intensified. At this time the only “unclaimed” land areas left in the world existed in Africa. Those land areas were claimed by the era’s super powers. The European powers mostly used the colonies to extract rare resources from the land to use in there factories.

In the early 19th century the working class started to appear. They were the middle ground between the poor in the large cities’ slums and the rich upper class. The worker class worked in the factory, they had often bad working conditions and long hours but towards the end of the 19th century they pushed for better working conditions and better pay.

The Victorian age did see many changes in the economy some of these changes are still seen in our modern day society. Some of the changes are things we think are normal in today’s society like that most people does not farm their own food.
