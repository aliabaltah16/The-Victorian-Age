The following is some events that influenced and was reflected on in the literature.<br>
Many valuables poured into Great Britain and Europe from their colonies. This meant that the rich got richer, the living conditions improved but the poor living conditions didn’t, and the gap between the rich and the poor grew.

<h2>Who are the main authors? Major Works?</h2>
<br><br>

The Brontë sisters are all quite well-known female authors of their time. Some female authors would publish novels under a male name not to reveal their female identity in order to avoid prejudice.
Anne, the youngest sister (1820-1849), had her work overshadowed by her two older sisters. Her most famous novel was The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.
<br><br>
Emily, (1818-1848) only wrote one novel, Wuthering Heights, which is today considered quite a passionate piece of work. It was however not met with the same praise when it was released.
<br><br>
The oldest sister, Charlotte (1816-1855) is well known for her novel Jane Eyre which brings up the inequality between the two genders. Two of her other novels were also published, Shirley and Villette.
<br><br>
Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) is another well known author and playwright, and his witty sayings are often quoted today, for example:
“Misfortunes one can endure, they come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's faults—ah! there is the sting of life.”
<br><br>
His plays are still being performed today. One of his famous plays is The Impotence of Being Earnest. Two of his famous poems were The Sphinx and The Ballad of Reading, that he wrote while in prison, which he was sent to because of his homosexuality.

 Charles Dickens was one of the most critical and essential authors during the Victorian era. Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, and he was married to Catherine Hogarth in 1836. 9th June 1870 is the day he passed away by a sudden stroke.

However, after his father was imprisoned because of his lousy debt, Dickens was forced to quit school and sent to work in Warren's blacking factory. Which was a boot polish factory were Dickens fixing labels to bottles of blacking.

Dickens started his working career as a journalist. During that time he started to write his stories in newspaper, and his novel 'Pickwick Papers' was the turning point that changed his career from a journalist to a writer. His unforgettable descriptions of a decent life, epic stories and characters gave him the uniqueness from any other writer.

<h2>Novel written by Charles Dickens</h2>
<br><br>
Oliver Twist is a novel written by the greatest novelist Charles Dickens. He was influential in bringing up the cruel treatment to children living in orphanage during Dickens time aka the Victorian age.  According to “ThoughtCo” the novel is not only a brilliant work, it is an important social document.
<br><br>
Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse. His mother passed away when she was giving birth which leads to him ending up in an orphanage. He was adopted and dipped away to find his fortune and ends up meeting a boy that made him join a criminal gang.
<br><br>
Oliver Twist’s story is dramatic because he gets caught pickpocketing plenty of times but as well as  being punished he gets threatened well. He was sent to rob a family called the Maylies but he was shot and left behind.
He was taken in by the Maylies which changed his life in a good way. They reunite him with someone that turned out to be his uncle.
<br><br>
 Nancy was a member in that gang that Oliver belonged in. She was often worried about Oliver and later murdered because she told the Maylies about Oliver's situation.  Fagin the leader of that gang was arrested and hanged due to his crimes.
<br><br>
I recommend Dickens’ novels due to the fact that his books are more enjoyable than you would think. His work were designed to be published in weekly parts in newspapers which made it interesting to look for, more like a tv series. His books are witty, humorous, deep - dark and reveal lacks in society. Charles Dickens’ work reveal society’s truths about child labour, class system (rich and poor) and much more.
<br><br>
<h4> Charles Dickens more than a novelist, a poet. </h4> <br><br>
According to the poem, Lucy’s Song is about lasting scars. It is a beautiful nature poem containing a dose of sadness for a loss at the end.
The narrator starts by giving us readers an image of the environment surrounding him. It is a beautiful and calm environment as he states in the following verse
<br><br>“How soft is Nature's calm repose
<br>When ev'ning skies their cool dews weep:
<br>The gentlest wind more gently blows,
<br>As if to soothe her in her sleep!”
<br>I can strengthen my interpretation with the last four sentences of his poem =>
<br>“In my breast alone
<br>Dark shadows remain;
<br>the peace it has known
<br>It can never regain.”
<br>This paragraph is deep and shows his sorrow.
<br>
