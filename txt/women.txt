The Victorian Era was one of the most potent ages in history and was named after Queen Victoria.
 The period where Britain was in bloom and the British Empire reached its height during her reign.
 In this age, the women were called  &#34The Angel in the House &#34. 
 Even the women rights were widely discussed during this period. However, there was a huge social difference between classes of women.

The women’s under this age was called &#34The Angel in the House&#34 because they have the power to raise the next generation,
they were supposed to be the domestic angel, weak, and obedient towards their husbands.
Most women’s under this age was married under a young age to men that were about 5 years older.

The best way to highlight and show the inequality and division between the classes were at the time, is to look at rich and poor in turn.
The higher levels as nobility and middle class have always expected to be highly educated and have plenty of time to enjoy the luxuries on life.
However, when we see at the working class women often had to work to support their families.
By working as a servant for the higher classes, such as running their home and raising their children.

In this era, women's were not supposed to study.
Besides, well-educated girls had to modify their erudition because they don't want to be called as a ‘blue-stocking’.
This name was given to women who had an educative background and was seen as unattractive,
which made many smart girls uneducated, for fear that they would make themselves unmarriageable.

Last but not least, the women rights were widely discussed, and at the end of it, the women’s voting movement began.
 Women's of every class united and became one hand against the injustice and inequality of the voting system.
